# Releasing OpenARIA

OpenARIA uses a manually dispatched GitHub Actions workflow and PyPI Trusted Publishing. No PyPI API token is stored in GitHub.

## One-time account setup

1. Create or sign in to your PyPI account and enable two-factor authentication.
2. In the PyPI account sidebar, open **Publishing** and add a pending GitHub trusted publisher:

   | Field | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | PyPI Project Name | `openaria` |
   | Owner | `soloshun` |
   | Repository name | `openaria` |
   | Workflow name | `release.yml` |
   | Environment name | `pypi` |

3. In GitHub, create a repository environment named `pypi`. Add yourself as a required reviewer before publishing to PyPI.
4. Repeat the pending-publisher setup on TestPyPI with environment `testpypi`, then create a matching GitHub environment named `testpypi`.

A pending publisher does not reserve a package name; it becomes a normal publisher when the first matching release succeeds. Use the exact package name in `pyproject.toml` and PyPI.

## Release procedure

1. Update the version in `pyproject.toml`, `src/openaria/__init__.py`, and `CHANGELOG.md` together.
2. Run the local release checks:

   ```bash
   uv lock
   uv run ruff format --check .
   uv run ruff check .
   uv run mypy src
   uv run python scripts/generate_config_schema.py --check
   uv run pytest
   uv build --no-sources
   ```

3. Commit and push the version change to `main`.
4. In GitHub Actions, run **Release package** manually. Enter the exact declared version and choose `testpypi`.
5. Test the result from a clean environment. This script creates a temporary virtual environment, installs only the published package, checks the import and CLI version, exercises initialization, doctor, and rule validation, prints the result, and removes all temporary files when it exits:

   ```bash
   bash scripts/verify_published_package.sh openaria 0.0.1
   ```

   Pass `https://pypi.org/simple/` as the third argument when verifying a production PyPI release.

6. Run **Release package** again with the same version and select `pypi`. The `pypi` environment provides the manual approval boundary.

PyPI release files are immutable. If a release has a packaging defect, publish a new version rather than attempting to overwrite `0.0.1`.

## Installing from another project

After publishing to PyPI:

```bash
uv add "openaria>=0.0.1,<0.1.0"
```

For a one-off environment installation:

```bash
pip install openaria
```
