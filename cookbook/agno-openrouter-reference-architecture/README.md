# Agno + OpenRouter reference-architecture cookbook

This is a separate application that uses OpenARIA's framework ideas to demonstrate the paper’s seven-layer architecture with synthetic context. It does not add FastAPI, Agno, or OpenRouter as OpenARIA core dependencies.

## What it demonstrates

- A manually started FastAPI service simulates the pipeline estate, telemetry, lineage, verification context, and a separate Markdown knowledge library.
- An Agno agent uses OpenRouter only when `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` is explicitly set.
- The agent has bounded tools for incident/context retrieval, framework diagnosis, runbook/playbook and synthetic-code reads, local diagnosis recording, approval requests, and final Markdown export.
- `get_framework_diagnosis` runs the cookbook's `openaria.yml` and `rules.yml` through OpenARIA, proving that the application uses the framework rather than hardcoding a diagnosis rule in the agent.
- The agent may investigate and propose the synthetic allowlisted playbook, but it cannot execute an action.
- The proposed schema change requires human approval; verification remains `not_run` because no remediation runs.

## Setup

From this cookbook directory:

```bash
uv sync
cp .env.example .env
```

Start the synthetic service in one terminal:

```bash
uv run uvicorn demo_service:app --reload
```

In another terminal, choose one of the scenarios below. The first scenario needs no model key; the other two deliberately bypass the configured deterministic rule and require an OpenRouter key.

### 1. Configured schema drift (deterministic only)

```bash
uv run python run_agent.py --incident-id schema-drift-001
```

The `KeyError: 'Close'` signature matches `rules.yml`. OpenARIA writes `.openaria/reports/schema-drift-001-deterministic.md` and a local SQLite memory record. No LLM request is made.

### 2. Unfamiliar code error (LLM investigation)

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="..."
export OPENARIA_DEMO_MODEL="deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash"
uv run python run_agent.py --incident-id code-error-001
```

This incident has an unfamiliar `adjusted_price` error, so the agent can inspect `synthetic_project/src/price_transform.py`. Once it has investigated, it must call `export_analysis` exactly once. That tool writes the final human-readable report to `.openaria/reports/code-error-001-llm.md` and records it in local SQLite memory.

### 3. Sensitive data in telemetry (LLM investigation with redaction)

```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="..."
uv run python run_agent.py --incident-id pii-leak-001
```

This synthetic incident contains an email address, API key, phone number, SSN, and test card number in its source telemetry. The FastAPI service models an unsafe upstream payload; it is not what the model sees. OpenARIA redacts JSON-like tool responses before the agent receives them, so the agent sees markers such as `[REDACTED_EMAIL]` and `[REDACTED_SECRET]`, and its final report is saved as `.openaria/reports/pii-leak-001-llm.md`.

Do not place real credentials or personal data in this cookbook. The redactor is a conservative demonstration baseline, not a complete organization-specific DLP system.

## How the investigation flows

1. `run_agent.py` first runs the cookbook's `openaria.yml` and `rules.yml` through OpenARIA's deterministic diagnosis engine.
2. A rule match produces the deterministic report immediately. An unknown diagnosis requires an explicitly configured OpenRouter call.
3. The agent can only access named, read-only tools: incident metadata, individual context items, selected Markdown knowledge, and one allowlisted synthetic code directory.
4. The agent may recommend a playbook and request human approval, but has no execution tool.
5. For an LLM scenario, `export_analysis` is the required final tool. It persists the model's Markdown rather than losing the agent's more readable explanation in terminal output.

## Knowledge library

The cookbook stores project knowledge separately from telemetry:

- `knowledge/runbooks/schema-drift-investigation.md` explains how to investigate a schema drift incident.
- `knowledge/playbooks/schema_mismatch_in_dataframe.md` defines the allowlisted recommendation and its approval boundary.

The FastAPI service exposes each document through a bounded read-only endpoint. This models how a real project can keep runbooks and playbooks in version-controlled Markdown while giving an agent only the documents it needs.

## Safety boundary

All data is synthetic. The service has no write endpoint. The agent has no shell, unrestricted web-search, cloud, database, or remediation tool. Sensitive values are redacted before context reaches an agent tool or framework diagnostic report. Live model calls are opt-in and must not run in CI.

## Relation to OpenARIA

The cookbook owns the FastAPI service, synthetic data, and Agno/OpenRouter integration. OpenARIA remains the reusable framework that provides the incident, diagnosis, configuration, memory, report, and lifecycle contracts used by future cookbook adapters.
